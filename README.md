# Digital Objects Ontology and DCAT Application Profile for CEH

## Working notes

- Maybe change the name to Digital Assets Ontology given our new team name?

## Overview

- These two semantic assets work hand-in-hand to enable rich metadata descriptions of datasets
- Diagrams for both made with [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) using [Chowlk Visual Notation](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation.html), plus custom notation (see [legend](/legend.png))

## The Digital Objects Ontology

- See [this folder](/ontology/)
- Two main modules, from FRAPO and SmOD
- Also heavily relies on PROV-O
- Scope: diverse research outputs (articles, datasets), the projects which allowed the creation of the outputs, the grants that funded the projects, environmental monitoring facilities, programmes, activities and networks, the people and organisations who contributed to the projects and outputs, and their roles
- This ontology is compatible with the [CEH DCAT AP](/CEH-DCAT-AP/)
- This ontology will be compatible with work being done on [modelling workflows](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/workflows-ontology) and modelling observed properties in datasets
